# Smart-Agriculture-and-Crop-Yield-Prediction-AI-ML-project.
# 1. Problem Statement

Farmers often struggle to predict how much crop they can grow because of changing weather, soil quality, and other factors. This project uses data science to create a simple model that predicts crop yield based on weather, soil, and farming practices.

The goal is to help farmers make better decisions, grow more food, and use their resources like water and fertilizers efficiently.
# 2. Objectives

**1.Boost Crop Production**: Help farmers grow more crops with smart predictions.

**2.Save Time and Money**: Provide tips to reduce waste of water, fertilizers, and effort.

**3.Make Smarter Choices**: Recommend the best crops to grow for higher profits.

**4.Prepare for Challenges**: Warn about risks like droughts or pests in advance.

**5.Support Sustainable Farming**: Promote eco-friendly and efficient farming practices.
